# LLM Prompting for Multi-Class Sexism Detection
Zero-shot and few-shot classification with open-source Large Language Models.

---

##  Overview
This project explores the use of open-source LLMs for multi-class sexism detection (EDOS Task B), using structured prompting strategies in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

The focus is on prompt design, automated response parsing, and systematic evaluation.
